2.Explain joins with example and output.
   Retrieving data from two or more than two tables based on common field.
 Types:
INNER JOIN
FULL JOIN
LEFT JOIN
RIGHT JOIN
1.SELECT Employee.EmpID,Employee.EmpFname,Employee.EmpLname,Projects.ProjectID,Projects.ProjectName
FROM Employe table
INNER JOIN Projects ON Employee.EmpID=Projects.EmpID;
2.SELECT Employee.EmpFname,Employee.EmpLname,Projects.ProjectID
FROM Employe table
FULL JOIN Projects ON Employee.EmpID=Projects.EmpID;
3.SELECT Employee.EmpFname,Employee.EmpLname,Projects.ProjectID,Projects.ProjectName
FROM Employe table
LEFT JOIN ON Employee.EmpID = Projects.EmpID ;
4.SELECT Employee.EmpFname,Employee.EmpLname,Projects.ProjectID,Projects.ProjectName
FROM Employe table
RIGHT JOIN ON Employee.EmpID = Projects.EmpID;

3. Write a SQL query to Rename the column name.
 ALTER TABLE Employe;
RENAME COLUMN EMP TO EMP ID;

4. Write a SQL query to find duplicate records
 SELECT EMP NAME,GENDER  
FROM Employe table
GROUP BY EMP NAME, GENDER
HAVING (COUNT(EMP NAME) > 1) AND (COUNT(GENDER) > 1);

5.How do we use the DISTINCT statement? What are its use?
Inside a table and column often contains many duplicate values,and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values.
SYNTAX 
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;

6. Remove duplicate from the table 
SELECT EMP_NAME,SECTION,CONTACT_INFO,LOCATION, COUNT(*) 
FROM EMP table
GROUP BY EMP_NAME,SECTION,CONTACT_INFO,LOCATION
HAVING COUNT(*)>1;

7.Print max salary for a particular department 
SELECT DEPT_ID,MAX(SALARY) 
FROM emp table
GROUP BY DEPT_ID;

8.Use different operators in SQL 
EQUAL
SELECT * FROM Students
WHERE Age = 20;
GREATER THAN
SELECT * 
FROM students
WHERE Age > 23;
LESS THAN
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE Age <25;
ANY 
SELECT * FROM Students
WHERE Age > ANY (SELECT Age FROM Students WHERE Age > 21);
AND
SELECT * FROM Students
WHERE Age BETWEEN 22 AND 25;
IN
SELECT * FROM Students
WHERE Age IN('23', '20');

9."What is Query to display first 5 Records from
Employee table?"
SELECT TOP 5* 
FROM emp table;

10."What is Query to display last 5 Records from

SELECT * 
FROM emp table 
WHERE rownum <= Rows_to_return 
ORDER BY rownum DESC;

11. "How to fetch 3rd highest salary using Rank

from Employee table

FROM EMPLOYEE 
WHERE 1=2;
